How computer store -ve integer?
    It store the 2's complement of that number 
what is the minimum value it can store?
    i.e. -2^31 and it stores 2's complement so number is 1 0 0 0 0 0 00 0.....

AND operator (&) 
{
    all true --> true
    one false --> false
}

OR ( | )
{
    one true --> true
    all false --> false
}

XOR ( ^ )
{
    no of 1 is odd --> 1
    no of 1 is even --> 0
}

Right shift ( >> )
{
    x = n >> 1 (it means right sift n by 1 position). //Generally divisible by 2

    OR
    (x / 2^k)
}


Left Shift ( >> )
{
    x = n << 1 (it means left shift n by 1 position). //Genera multiplied by 2

    OR
    (x * 2^k)
}

NOT operator ( ~ )
{
    ~x 
    If the number is positive flip the digits then if the flipped digit is negative then store its 2s complement

    if the number is negative find 2s complement and then flip and do the same thing
}


XOR {
    same number XOR is "zero"
    5 ^ 5 = 0

    Swap two number() {
        a = a ^ b
        b = a ^ b   // b = a ^ b ^ b so b = a
        a = a ^ b   // a = a ^ b ^ a  so a = b
    }

    Toggle the ith bit {
        (n ^ (1 << i))
    }

    number of bits to change from A to B {
        ans = A ^ B; // 1 ^ 0 = 1 where the bits need to be flipped
        //This answer will be containing 1 where the bits need to be flipped 
    }
}
