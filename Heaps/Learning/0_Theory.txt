Priority Queue:
    Type of queue where each element is assigned a property, ans instead of processed in order 
    they are are processed based on Priority.
    --> If same Priority, then based on insertion order

Binary Heap:
    It is a binary tree that satisfies below conditions
    --> It should be a Complete Binary tree
    --> It should satisfy the heap property

Heap Property:
    Min Heap: For every node in a binary heap, if the node value is less than its right and 
              left child’s value then Binary Heap is known as Min Heap. The property of Node’s 
              value less than its children’s value is known as Min Heap property. In Min Heap, 
              the root value is always the Minimum value in Heap.
    Max Heap: For every node in a binary heap, if the node value is greater than its right and 
              left child’s value then Binary Heap is known as Max Heap. The property of being 
              Node’s value greater than its children's value is known as Max Heap property. In 
              Max Heap, the root value is always the maximum value in Heap.

Representation of Binary heap:
    Represented as Array
    --> The root value is at arr[0]

    If node at index i, then left child "2*i+1" and right child "2*i+2"
    if child node it at i, than parend "(i - 1) / 2"

Operation of Min Heap:
    - Insert(): insert new key in the Binary Heap [O(log N)]
        Steps:
            - First insert the new key at the first vacant position from the left on the last
              last level of the heap. If the the last level is completely filled, then insert
              the key as the left-most element in next level.
            - Inserting a new key at the first vacant position in the last level preserves
              the Complete Binary Tree Property, the Min Heap property may get affected we need
              to check for it.
            - If the inserted key present is less than the key, then the Min property is also not violated
            - If the parent is greater than the inserted key, then swap its values, Now the heap property
              may get violated at the parent node. So repeat the same process until the heap property is 
              satisfied.
            - O(log N)
    
    Heapify(): this is used to restore the MinHeap, by fixing violation [O(log N)]
        Steps:
            - First find out the Minimum among the Violated Node, left, and right child of 
              Violated Node.
            - If the Minimum among them is the left child, then swap the Violated Node value 
              with the Left child value and recursively call the function on the left Child.
            - If the Minimum among them is the right child, then swap the Violated Node value 
              with the right child value and recursively call the function right Child.
            - Recursive call stops when the heap property is not violated.
    
    getMin(): returns the minimum value in the Binary Heap. [O(1)]
        - root node is the minimum value in min Heap. return a[0];
    
    ExtractMin(): Removes the minimum element from the heap. [O(log N)]
        Steps:
            - Copy the last Node value to the Root Node, and decrease the size, this means 
              that the root value is now deleted from the heap, and the size is decreased by 1.
            - By doing the above step we ensure that the Complete binary tree property is not 
              violated, as we are copying the last node value to the root node value, the Min 
              Heap property gets violated.
            - Call the Heapify function to convert it into a valid heap.
    
    DecreaseKey(): Given an index and a value, we need to update the value at the index with 
                   the given value. We assume that the given value is less than the existing 
                   value at that index.  [O(log N)]
        Steps:
            - Let’s the index be i and the value be new_val. Update existing value at index 
              i with new_val i.e arr[i] = new_val. 
            - By performing the above step, the Complete binary tree property is not violated, 
              but the Min heap property may get violated.
            - As the new_val we are inserting is less than the previously existing value, the 
              min-heap property is not violated in subtrees of this rooted tree. 
            - It may get violated in its ancestors, so as we do in insert operation, check the 
              value of a current node with its parent node, if it violates the min-heap property
            Swap the nodes and recursively do the same.
    
    Delete(): Given an index, delete the value at that index from the min-heap.  [O(log N)]
        Steps:
            - First, update the value at the index that needs to be deleted with INT_MIN.
            - Now call the Decreasekey() function at the index which is need to be deleted. 
              As the value at the index is the least, it reaches the top.
            - Now call the ExtractMin() operation which deletes the root node in Minheap.
            - In this way, the desired index value is deleted from the Minheap.
